# Japakana

A simple web application that lets Japanese language learners study any combination of Hiragana and Katakana characters. Currently, the app is in a usable state, but I have not yet finished implementing all of the planned features (see the Issues section).

## Usage

Access the app here: https://japakana62.lktfirelight.workers.dev/

Alternatively, you can clone the repo, run `npm install` inside the cloned repo to install dependencies and then `npm start` to start the development server at http://localhost:5173/.
